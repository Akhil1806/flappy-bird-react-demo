# Java Introduction

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

## Key Features
- **Object-Oriented**: Everything is an object.
- **Platform Independent**: Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA).
- **Simple**: Designed to be easy to learn.
- **Secure**: Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
