# C++ Basics

C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

## Syntax
C++ syntax is similar to C, but adds object-oriented features.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

## Pointers
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
```cpp
string food = "Pizza";
string* ptr = &food;
```
