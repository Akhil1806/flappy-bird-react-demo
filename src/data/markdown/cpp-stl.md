# C++ STL

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions.

## Components
1. **Containers**: vector, list, map, set, etc.
2. **Algorithms**: sort, search, reverse, etc.
3. **Iterators**: Objects that point to an element in a container.

```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3};
v.push_back(4);
```
